Interfaces: <br/>
Define an interface named Shape representing a geometric shape. The
interface should include methods for calculating the area (calculateArea()) and
perimeter (calculatePerimeter()). <br/>
Create a class Circle that implements the Shape interface. Add necessary
fields (e.g., radius) and implement methods to calculate the area and perimeter of
the circle. <br/> <br/>
Abstract Classes: <br/>
Define an abstract class Vehicle representing a means of transportation.
Include an abstract method start() that must be implemented in the child classes.
Create two classes, Car and Motorcycle, inheriting from the abstract class
Vehicle. Implement the start() method in each of these classes.
